      <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the</p> 
      <p>CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black</p> 
      <p>highlighters.</p>
      <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred</p> 
      <p>by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that</p> 
      <p>began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
      <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several</p> 
      <p>historic events, such as: </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
